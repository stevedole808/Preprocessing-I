          <p>I’m an eighteen-year-old living in Oahu, Hawaii. I'm currently attending Lambda  School pursuing a career in Full Stack Web Development. I look to impact and change  this world through tech and entrepreneurship. Before enrolling in Lambda, my life  revolves around being an entrepreneur and that was my main focus. But, as I saw the  world around me towards such a huge technological aspect, there was no other direction  that I saw that could impact this world. I am yet to determice how, but that will not stop me from exploring, learning, and improving  myself and skillset in order to attain these goals.</p>
